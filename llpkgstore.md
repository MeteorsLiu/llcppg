# LLpkg Store Documentation
## Definitions
### LLpkg
Generated by a toolchain from an _upstream_. An LLpkg essentially represents a collection of bindings for C/C++ dynamic libraries in Go, allowing them to be used like native Go functions.
### Upstream
The provider of binary libraries. Currently only Conan is supported.
### Toolchain
A suite of tools for generating LLpkgs.
## Generation
### Directory Structure
We design a whole new storage structure for llpkg store.
```
+ {LibraryName}
   |
   +-- {NormalGoPkgFiles}
   |    
   +-- llpkg.cfg
   |    
   +-- llcppg.cfg
   |
   +-- .llpkg
         |
         +-- llcppg.symb.json
         |
         +-- llcppg.pub
```
- `llpkg.cfg` declares essential information for llgo module
- `llcppg.cfg` / `llcppg.symb.json` / `llcppg.pub` customize generation behavior in `llcppg` tool
### Version Management
Follow Go's version management for nested modules. Tag `{LibraryName}/{Version}` for each version.

Example:
`libcjson/v1.7.18`
This design is fully compatible with native Go modules, enabling simple installation via:
```bash
go get github.com/goplus/llpkg/libcjson@v1.7.18
```
### Reproducible Builds
Standardized methodology for generating compliant, reproducible LLpkgs:
1. Retrieve binaries/headers from upstream and index them into a .pc file
2. Automatically generate LLpkg using the toolchain
3. Debug and re-generate LLpkg by modifying the configuration file
### Publication via GitHub Action
Recommended approach to maintain security and reproducibility:
**Workflow:**
1. Validate configuration files (llpkg.cfg & *.symb.json)
2. Create PR to trigger GitHub Action
3. Review generated LLpkg
4. Merge PR with version tag
**Maintenance:**
- Updates must be published as new versions with -patchX suffix
- Example: `version` -> `version-patch1`
## Usage
Install LLpkgs using:
```bash
llgo get pkgname@version
```

(Where version corresponds to the original C library version)

Installation process:
1. Prepend `github.com/goplus/llpkg` address to `pkgname` and convert `version` according to specified rules
2. Download LLpkg via `go get`
3. Process configuration:
   - Read llpkg.cfg
   - Run `conan install` for binaries
   - Store .pc files for building
## Version Conversion Rules [wip]

There are two methods for converting versions:

### 1. Conversion by a formula

1. **Semver-compliant versions**: Use directly
   - Example: 2.1.5 → 2.1.5
2. **Non-Semver versions**: Convert using pattern:
   ``` 
   0.0.0-0-{original_version}
   ```
   Conversion steps:
   1. Replace dots with hyphens
   2. Append `0-` prefix
   Examples:
   - `2023Q4 → 0.0.0-0-2023Q4`
   - `2023.07.05 → 0.0.0-0-2023-07-05`
   - `0067 → 0.0.0-0-0067`

### 2. Conversion by mapping

#### Semver Bumping Rules

**Initial Version**
  If the C package is stable, then start with `v1.0.0`; Otherwise, start with `v0.1.0`.
**Bumping Rules**
  We don't have to obey the original version's bump due to the original version may not follow the SemVer rules.
  - MAJOR version bump: When the C library has made incompatible API changes (MAJOR).
  - MINOR version bump: When the C library has added functionality in a backwards-compatible manner (MINOR), or it has backward compatible bug fixes (**PATCH**). For example, the original version is `v1.0.0`, and the new version would be `v1.1.0`.
  - PATCH version bump: When we found a bug in the previous llpkg (**Not Related to the C library**), we will bump the patch version.
  - Pre-release versions of C library like `v1.2.3-beta.2` would not be accepted.
  - **Note**: Please note that the version number of the llpkg is **not related** to the version number of the C library. The PATCH update of the c library will be the MINOR update of the llpkg, as the PATCH update of the llpkg is related to llpkg bug fixes.
