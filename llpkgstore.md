This document provides a high-level overview of the official llpkgs generation process & usage.

# Definition

## LLpkg 
Generated by a toolchain from an *upstream*. An LLpkg essentially represents a collection of bindings for C/C++ dynamic libraries in Go, allowing them to be used like native Go functions.

## Upstream
The provider of binary libraries. Currently only Conan is supported.

## Toolchain
A suite of tools for generating LLpkgs.

# Generation

## Reproducible Builds  
A standardized methodology to generate compliant, reproducible, and controllable LLpkgs:

1. Retrieve binaries/headers from upstream and index them into a .pc file
2. Automatically generate LLpkg using the toolchain of a specific version
3. Debug and re-generate LLpkg by modifying the configuration file, and then publish

## Publication via GitHub Action

The recommended approach is to upload only configuration files and automate generation through GitHub Actions.

### Reason  
- Direct user publication carries risks of post-generation malicious code insertion and review challenges. 
- Platform-specific code may require different llcppg.symb.json to be generated, and should be renamed as `{$FILENAME}_{$GOOS}_{$GOARCH}`.

### Workflow  
1. After validating the configuration file llpkg.cfg & *.symb.json (verifying its capability to generate LLpkgs automatically), create a PR to trigger a universal GitHub Action. This will generate the LLpkgs in different architectures and commit them to the PR.
2. Reviewers can verify and debug the generated LLpkg. Edits should be limited to llpkg.cfg & llcppg.symb.json, as other Go code is auto-generated and will be overwritten.
3. Once approved, merge the PR and publish the LLpkg. The commit should be tagged with `pkgname/semver`.

### Maintenance
All updates must be published as new versions with a -patchX suffix (X = integer).

Example: `1.0.0-1.1.7 → 1.0.0-1.1.7-patch1`

# Usage  
`llgo get pkgname@version`  
(Where version corresponds to the original C library version)

Process:
1. Prepend `github.com/goplus/llpkg` address to pkgname and convert version according to specified rules
2. Use `go get` with the transformed address to download the LLpkg
3. Process configuration:
- Read `llpkg.cfg`
- Run `conan install` for binaries
- Activate environment variables for building (or use .pc file method)

## Platform-Specific Builds

To handle functional differences across platforms:

- Store platform-specific symbol mappings in `.llpkg/`
- File naming format:
`{$PACKAGE_NAME}_{$GOOS}_{$GOARCH}.symb.json`
(e.g., `openssl_linux_amd64.symb.json`)

## Version Conversion Rules

1. **Semver-compliant versions**: Use directly

    Example: 2.1.5 → 2.1.5

2. **Non-Semver versions**: Convert using pattern:

    `1.0.0-{original_version}-llgo`

    Conversion steps:

    1. Replace dots with hyphens: 2023.07.05 → 2023-07-05

    2. Append -llgo suffix

    Examples:

    `2023Q4 → 1.0.0-2023Q4-llgo`

    `0067 → 1.0.0-0067-llgo`

## File Structure of llpkg.cfg

```json
{
    "package": {
        "name": "cjson",
        "version": "1.7.18"
    },
    "upstream": {
        "name": "conan",
        "config": {
            "generator": "cmake",
            "options": ""
        }
    },
    "toolchain": {
        "name": "llcppg",
        "version": "0.9.7",
        "config": {
            "trimPrefixes": []
        }
    }
}
```
